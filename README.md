# React Amsterdam 2018 Talk Demos

This is the source for the demos presented at React Amsterdam 2018 during my mixed mode react talk.

## Starting the party

* run `yarn`
* run `yarn start`
* Go into `src/App.js` and swap out the rendered root component with the demo you want to run. (Ex: `<Canvas/>, <Three/> or <MixedMode/>`)

### Dank ass beats

Full versions of the music in the mixed mode demo can found and played during intimate moments by visiting my in-progress synthwave EP "Love Songs For Your Mother": https://soundcloud.com/thekenwheeler/sets/love-songs-for-your-mother
